# Control Hydroponic and Aeroponic Gardens From Webpage

### Overview

This project contains an overview of all the parts needed to make an arduino clone that is controlled by a webpage running on a Raspberry Pi. The page can be set up to be accessed from the internet. This project contains:
1. The hardware files to replicate the Arduino clones
2. The code to run on each clone
3. A minimual Node server and code to control the arduino clones via clicks on the webpage.

This tool can be used to learn I2C, which has few tutorials to help learn. This can also be used to make the Pi communicate with any Arduino via a web interface.

Looking for collaborators to make a better interface and to write the garden code.
